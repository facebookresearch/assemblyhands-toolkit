    Perspective projection: `uv = xy / z`

    This has some nice properties:

    - straight lines map to straight lines
    - math is very nice, especially when working with homogeneous
      coordinates (4x4 matrices).
    - graphics rasterisers generally produce this by default

    However it produces extreme distortion at wide fields of view, and
    cannot represent FOV >= 180Â°.

    `project_perspective3()` returns the Z component unchanged.

    Arctan projection: uv = xy / |xy| * atan2(|xy|, z)

    This is what the Oculus fisheye models use: the length of the 2D
    u vector is the angle in radians between +Z and the target ray
    direction.

    Unlike perspective projection, this can represent a FOV over 180
    degrees. However, distortion increases as the FOV gets wider. Near
    180 degrees, the aspect ratio of a pixel is about 1:1.57, which
    must then be corrected for in the distortion function. (This is why
    the OVRFisheye model needed to move to 6 radial terms: it has more
    distortion to correct for.)

    It's also relatively expensive to compute on since there is a trig
    function involved.
